## VAbout

This project combines Deep Learning and Monte Carlo Simulation to predict human-infecting viruses using genomic data. Predictions were evaluated by aggregating probability estimates from multiple runs. Class 1 (human-infecting) entries were confidently classified if at least 75% of predictions exceeded 0.5 (Q1 > 0.5), while class 0 (non-human-infecting) entries were assigned when most predictions were below 0.5 (Q3 < 0.5).
